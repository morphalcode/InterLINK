# NEA Project - InterLINK
My codebase for the Non-Exam Assessment which accounts for 20% of the A-Level Computer Science grade. Achieved full marks for the project and A* for the course.

interLINK is a social and professional network manager developed for a client using Python and flask. It has features such as a login system, network statistics (including viewing connections on a map), and the ability to import from LinkedIn and Google Contacts.
